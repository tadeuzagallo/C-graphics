# C graphics #

C graphics is a tiny library that wraps OpenGL to make it easier to create visualizations to your algorithms.

## Usage ##

Right now there are just a few methods available, the prototypes are defined on lib/graphics.h

  $ git clone git://github.com/tadeuzagallo/C-graphics.git && cd C-graphics
  $ make samples
  
It will compile both examples Balls and Convex Hull.

To execute them just:

  $ cd examples/balls && ./ball 100

or
  
  $ cd examples/Convex\ Hull && ./convex 26
